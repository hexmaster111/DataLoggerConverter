Program by Hailey Gruszynski for Imbeded Systems 2021


Just throw your .csv files from the sdcard into the input folder and run bulkconvert.sh

Runs on python3 and that *should* be the only dependancy

you can also use the convert.py all by its self with

convert.py INPUT.csv OUTPUT.kml 
where input is your input file and out is what you want the program to write
